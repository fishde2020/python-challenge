In this challenge, I used a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses.

My task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

The total number of months included in the dataset,The total net amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period,The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period,The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period and The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

Analysis Result Below:

The final script prints the analysis to the terminal and exports as fainancial_analysis.txt  file.

In this challenge, I have the task of supporting  a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.

I used a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset comprises three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. My task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

The total number of votes cast,a complete list of candidates who received votes,The percentage of votes each candidate won,The total number of votes each candidate won and The winner of the election based on popular vote.

 Analysis Result is:
